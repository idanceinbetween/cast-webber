# Cast Away (Work in progress)
A web app for podcast listeners to take notes and discover podcast episodes.

## Description
The idea of this app is based on a real life problem of mine which is not unlike other users (e.g. https://medium.com/@joshdance/how-to-take-notes-on-podcasts-d30e9233191). I just couldn't believe that there is no existing solution out there, and hope to find out why it is so. In an ideal world, this would be a mobile app, or available on some sort of wearables.

This is a work-in-progress project that serves these purposes:
- to practise my coding skills in initially on Ruby on Rails and JavaScript. It might evolve into using other languages that better serve the project.
- to practise considering effective UX/UI design.
- to discover the journey of developing a digital product first hand.

## MVP:
- Users can make notes on podcast episodes, through simple/minimal interaction. The reality is that users listen to podcast when they are visually and physically occupied - how to balance this?
- Users will receive recommendations on related podcasts/episodes specifically from their own podcast collection, from their circle of friends and from out of their social circle. This feature is a thought process on how to break information bubbles due to algorithms that suggest only similar items. ListenNotes API might be used for this.
